# Convex Neural Network Optimization with CVXPY
This is an implementation of Convex Neural Network Optimization using the [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/)
 library. The implementation solves the problem of optimizing a neural network with convex loss functions and linear constraints.

The implementation is based on the paper "[Convex Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2005/file/0fc170ecbb8ff1afb2c6de48ea5343e7-Paper.pdf)" by Yoshua Bengio, Nicolas Le Roux, Pascal Vincent, Olivier Delalleau, and Patrice Marcotte, published in 2006.
